# Store API Project
 
Welcome to my E-commerce API, a scalable and modular web API built using ASP.NET Core Web API. This project focuses on providing core functionalities for an online store, including product management, user authentication, role-based access control, shopping cart, and order processing.

This API is designed with clean architecture principles, repository pattern, dependency injection, and JWT-based authentication to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security.

ðŸš€ Key Features:
Product Management: Full CRUD operations for products, categories, and brands.

User Authentication: JWT-based login and registration with secure password hashing.

Role-Based Access: Admin and user roles to control access levels.

Order Management: Create and track orders, with a shopping cart system.

Clean Architecture: Separation of concerns across layers with repository pattern and service layer.

Validation: Input validation using FluentValidation and data annotations.

Entity Framework Core: Seamless database integration with migrations and LINQ queries.

API Documentation: Fully documented using Swagger UI.
